## Known bugs & Limitations:
- Some AutoHotKey scripts interrupt `autosyntax`, especially if they reprogram `home` button.
- When input is extraordinarily long, `autosyntax` may fail to convert it

## In the near future:
- GUI will be optional
- JSON config files
- Type Annotations can be configured to either adhere to [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) or via docstring (old style)
